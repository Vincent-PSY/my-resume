<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>“<em>A dream you dream alone is only a dream. A dream you dream together is reality.</em>” John Lennon</p>

<p>Of course, I didn't just choose this quote to look particularly clever in my portfolio, but because it also means something to me. Dreaming is a wonderful thing that allows you to imagine futures that have not yet happened. However, these ideas are not yet reality and can become so with a little creativity. </p>
<p>Creativity is the keyword. A person, regardless of their field of work, should be creative. At the moment, the productive part of my life consists of four things: </p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Studying Psychology</strong>: it's an art to memorize so much for every exam, so you start getting creative. You make colorful cheat sheets and try to inhale information in a cleverly bundled way</li><br>
  <li><strong>Programming</strong>: why you are here I assume. Here it is not only useful but necessary to be creative and solve problems. Not only in Python or JavaScript, but also in design it is important to have a higher goal in mind.</li><br>
  <li><strong>Making Music</strong>: Sure if you make your own music, but maybe not so clear if you play music. If you only have notes and chords, but perhaps you can't yet grasp them like an expert, you need to be creative in order to achieve your goal.</li><br>
  <li><strong>Working in a Drug Store</strong>: I work part-time in a drugstore early in the morning and am under massive time pressure to complete all my daily tasks. You coordinate and get creative about how to solve tasks faster than the day before, can pass on these ideas and thus increase the productivity of the whole store.</li><br>
</ol>

<p>As you can see, I am broadly positioned in all areas of life and this experience enables me to think outside the box.

<p>Contact me to find out more. I look forward to every conversation.</p>

 <h3>1. Good Will Hunting</h3>
 <p>This movie influenced me to become a psychologist. I could cry endlessly every time I watch it and I loved Robin Williams so much in it.</p>
 
 <h3>2. Interstellar</h3>
 <p>Get me hooked everytime. Movies in space always catch me but this is particular thrilling. </p>

 <h3>3.Everything Everywhere All At Once</h3>
 <p>First time I thought it's all right. Second time I cried my eyes out because I now understand how beatufiul the message is. Be always kind.</p>
